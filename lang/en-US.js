          Courses from experts in the field of modern psychosomatics.
          We break down how psychosomatics affects all aspects of our lives.

          are interrelated. We teach you to get rid of symptoms and help not only
          yourself but also your close ones, friends, and clients.

        <p>
          I put up with the fact that I wouldn’t have a normal life like
          everyone else. But one day, I took a projective test
          where I had to describe animals. It turned out that I was
          describing myself, the way I was – that’s how I managed
          to see myself from the outside.

         It felt like a strike of lightning, I began to feel myself, hear
         myself. And the voice inside responded: “Anton, you can
         do more, you can do better”. Thus, I gradually got rid of addictions
         and in 2008 I got involved in psychology.

          In 2014, I became a psychologist, and in 2018 a clinical

        techniques, sought professional medical help. At some point, I was
        looking for a psychologist who could help me with this problem, and
        I found not just a psychologist but a specialist in psychosomatics.

                Hello, Anton, I’d like to thank Mikhail for the session
                we had. My request was related to my child’s cold, but
                as a result, we worked through my fear of men (I confessed
                to Mikhail that I couldn’t manage to feel my body and I
                was somewhat ashamed of it. He responded to this immediately
                and I still can’t fully understand how I started to trust
                him as well as other men (I’ve checked, and now I easily
                walk around the streets and don’t shy away from men))) We
                also touched on the issue of excess weight, and I’ve taken
                another step towards my perfect figure)) As for the request
                regarding my child’s cold  - we worked through it several
                times, for which I’m forever grateful 🙏

                Hello! I would like to leave some feedback on my session with
                Svetlana from your team… I wrote it to her personally
                and now I copy it here…
                </p>
                <p>
                The session that we had today was amazing!! It was very
                exciting to witness and experience the events that took
                place when I was still in my mother’s womb...!!! It was
                so pleasant (after we worked everything out)) !!! It was
                a fascinating experience and I am happy that I had it
                with you!!! Now I feel calm and carefree with joy!
                Svetlana, I am so GRATEFUL to you!!!

                стеснение перед ним, на&nbsp;что он&nbsp;быстро соориентировался

                <p>Да, сможете. Я&nbsp;разрабатываю новые психологические инструменты, которые можно применять самостоятельно. Мой собственный опыт и&nbsp;опыт моих студентов говорит о&nbsp;том, что они работают. Кроме того вы&nbsp;всегда можете найти партнера для работы в&nbsp;чате учеников или наставников.</p>

                <p>Нет, это не&nbsp;обязательно. Вы&nbsp;можете сразу заходить на&nbsp;третий курс, он&nbsp;является базовым, несмотря на&nbsp;название и&nbsp;помогает выстроить устойчивое внутреннее состояние. Материал организован таким образом, чтобы всё было понятно не&nbsp;зависимо от&nbsp;ваших знаний в&nbsp;психологии. После этого, если вы&nbsp;захотите глубже погрузиться в&nbsp;тему психосоматики или начать работать с&nbsp;другими людьми, вы&nbsp;всегда сможете докупить оставшиеся курсы.</p>
